# Time Complexity

Part 1: O(N)

Part 2: O(N)

# Analysis
Part 1: A relatively simple question that involves file parsing, and keeping track of maximum.

Part 2: A little more challenging than part i in terms of time complexity. However, managed to get linear time by using something like a **sliding window** algorithm.
